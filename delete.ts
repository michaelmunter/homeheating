// in my nextjs app the client will continually require complex server calculations based on client input and data from a mysql db. i have to decide between keeping it all in ts with vercel hosting and db in london, which is simple, or incorporating python specifically for the calculations via, for instance, flask and docker, which is more complex but brings advantages in complex math calculations and communication with the specialists involved in the project. Please advice on the level of workload required to move these server calculations to python and if docker is the best choice.
